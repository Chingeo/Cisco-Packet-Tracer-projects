Configuring a router using Cisco Packet Tracer involves several steps to ensure the network operates correctly. Below, I'll walk you through the process step-by-step. This example will cover basic router setup, including configuring interfaces, setting up routing, and testing connectivity.

Step-by-Step Router Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer
Open Cisco Packet Tracer:

Launch the Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.
Add Devices:

Drag and drop a router and two PCs onto the workspace.
Optionally, you can add switches between the router and the PCs if desired.
Connect Devices:

Use the "Connections" tool to connect the PCs to the router.
For direct connections, use the copper straight-through cable.

Configure IP Addresses on PCs:

Click on a PC, go to the "Desktop" tab, and open the "IP Configuration" window.
Assign an IP address and subnet mask to each PC.
 For example:
PC1: IP Address: 192.168.1.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
PC2: IP Address: 192.168.2.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Configure Router Interfaces:

Click on the router and go to the "CLI" tab to access the command line interface.

Enter privileged EXEC mode by typing enable.

Enter Global Configuration Mode:

Type configure terminal to enter global configuration mode.
Configure Router Interfaces:

Assign IP addresses to the router interfaces connected to each network.

Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit

Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit

Configure PCs with Default Gateway:

Go back to each PC, and in the "IP Configuration" window, set the default gateway to the IP address of the router's interface on their respective network.

PC1: Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

PC2: Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1

PC1 Configuration:

IP Address: 192.168.1.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

PC2 Configuration:

IP Address: 192.168.2.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1

Verify Connectivity:

Go to each PC's CLI and use the ping command to test connectivity to the other PC and the router interfaces.

From PC1, type ping 192.168.2.2 to ping PC2.
From PC2, type ping 192.168.1.2 to ping PC1.
